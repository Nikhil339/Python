In the cosmic expanse, galaxies swirl in majestic spirals, 
stars ignite in cosmic brilliance, and planets orbit in celestial dance. 
Black holes, enigmatic cosmic voids, hide secrets of the universe, while nebulae birth stars in luminous nurseries. 
Earth, a pale blue dot, spins in the vastness, a tiny storyteller in the cosmic saga.
