time complexity defines the amount of time the program takes to process the data.

Constant time algorithms:
- no loops
- complexity = 1
- number of lines to interpret is constant 

Linear time algorithms:
- has a loop
- complexity = n
- has to run the same instructions n times in a range(0,n)

Quadractic time algorithms:
- has a nested loop
- complexity = nÂ²

Both single and nested loop -- complexity decided by nested loop
